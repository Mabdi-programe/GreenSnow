                Welcome to GreenSnow, where we're dedicated to keeping your property looking its best no matter the season. We specialize in creating lush, healthy lawns during the warmer months and ensuring your driveways and walkways are clear and safe during the winter.
                Our story began with a simple goal: to help homeowners enjoy their outdoor spaces without the hassle of constant maintenance. What started as a small, family-operated service quickly grew into a trusted name in lawn care and snow removal. Today, we’re proud to offer year-round services that are tailored to meet the unique needs of our community.

            <h2>Our Journey</h2>    
            <p>
                Our journey began years ago when we noticed a gap in reliable seasonal property services. We saw homeowners struggling with overgrown lawns in the summer and hazardous icy driveways in the winter. Armed with a love for the outdoors, the right tools, and a passion for helping others, we set out to create a solution.
                Through hard work, attention to detail, and a focus on customer satisfaction, GreenSnow became the go-to service for year-round property care. What sets us apart is our dedication to building relationships: we don't just maintain properties; we take pride in making our customers’ lives easier and their homes more beautiful.
