## üìù Description 
-- GreenSnow Property Services Website Proposal -- 

In this Project we've created a website for GreenSnow Property Services. 

- We have created five different HTML files which include a home page, summer services page, winter services page, an about page, and a form. 

- Along with the HTML we have four separate CSS files connecting to their corresponding HTML file, and one global CSS file that maintains the layout theme for all pages. 

- Using bootstrap we were able to accomplish a lot of our CSS needs. Otherwise, we modified the individual CSS files to complete what was needed. All of these pages can be accessed through the navigation bar. 

- We have included a Javascript file which allows the form to be submitted and stored into local storage.
