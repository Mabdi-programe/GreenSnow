GreenSnow Property Services Website Proposal 

Description

In this Project we have put together a website for GreenSnow Property Services. We have created 5 different HTML files which include a home page, summer services page, winter services page, an about page, and a form. Along with the HTML we have 4 separate CSS files connecting to their corresponding HTML file and 1 global CSS file that maintains the layout theme for all pages. Using bootstrap we were able to accomplish a lot of our CSS needs. Otherwise, we modified the individual CSS files to complete what was needed. All of these pages can be accessed through the navigation bar. Lastly, we have included a Javascript file which allows the form to be submitted and stored into local storage.

Technologies Used

This project was completed using Windows and Apple operating systems, Bootstrap (HTML/CSS libraries), VS Code, and the web browser.
